# Comparing Two Samples using R

In this project, we are going to Parametric and Non-parametric tests to compare two samples in R. We are using R as it allows for easy random sampling and quick calculation.

The problem statement is taken from Chapter 11 (Comparing Two Samples) Question no. 50 of "Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis" by John A. Rice (University of California, Berkeley). 

### Data Description 

The data set bodytemp contains information about the body temperature, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, and the heart rates, measured in beats per minutes of 130 people. Among those people 65 are males (denoted as 1 in dataset), and 65 are females (denoted as 2 in dataset). In this assignment we will study if there are differences in body temperature and heart rate between the two genders.

### Problem Statement : 

It is written in the code as comments.
